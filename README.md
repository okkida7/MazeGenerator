# Maze Platformer Game with Custom Level Editor

## Introduction
This is a Maze Platformer Game that includes a custom level editor. The game was developed using Java's 2D Graphics API, File I/O, and JavaFX/Swing for GUI development. The application allows you to create diverse mazes using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.

## Key Concepts and Technologies
- **Java 2D Graphics API**: This is used for rendering all game elements, including characters and mazes, providing an appealing visual gameplay experience.
- **File I/O in Java**: Allows for saving and loading of custom levels. Serialization is used for storing game data.
- **GUI Development (JavaFX/Swing)**: The game presents an intuitive interface for gameplay and level editing. The interface includes features like menus and design tools.

## Features

### Maze Generation (DFS)
This is one of the central features of the game. It uses a DFS algorithm to construct mazes from cells. These mazes have adjustable dimensions and levels of complexity.

### Gameplay Mechanics
The game involves navigating through mazes while avoiding obstacles and solving puzzles.

### Level Editor
The game features a built-in tool that allows players to design their own custom mazes. This feature adds a layer of creativity and offers more replay value.

### Save/Load Functionality
Players can save their game progress and their custom designs so they can revisit them later.

### User Interface
The user interface is simple and accessible, making the game appealing to a broad range of players.

## Project Plan

- Implement a DFS algorithm for generating mazes.
- Develop the gameplay mechanics.
- Create an Integrated level editor.
- Implement the Save/Load feature using Java File I/O.
- Develop a user-friendly GUI using JavaFX/Swing.
- Test functionality and optimize features based on the feedback.
- Document the development process in detail for future reference and modifications.

## Conclusion
The Maze Platformer Game with a Custom Level Editor is a blend of gaming and creative expression. Leveraging Java's capabilities it aims to provide an engaging and distinct player experience, catering to both gaming enthusiasts and creative minds.# MazeGenerator
